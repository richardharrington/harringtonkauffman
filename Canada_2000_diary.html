        the diary which follows relates true events, for the most part, but it 
        is told by fictional characters from <b>Motel California</b>. 
        These characters occasionally refer to a famous 70's rock musician in 
        a in a familiar way. They also sometimes make reference to the former 
        name of <b>Motel California</b>. As it is no longer safe to 
        display either of these names on our website, they have been replaced 
        by &quot;[the Great One]&quot; and &quot;[Motel California],&quot; 
        respectively. In the one instance in which the name of the song after 
        which the show used to be named appears, it is called &quot;[the One True 
        Song].&quot;</font></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We have arrived 
        safely in Vancouver, after another bus and ferry ride, to a house full 
        of adults and children, with good music as well. Our new hosts Matt and 
        Selina have just finished reading their daughters</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> 
        to sleep with a Harry Potter novel, and Selina is preparing for a camping 
        trip tomorrow with some teenagers from the school where she works.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">And how was 
        Victoria, you ask? Well, they administer the death penalty for putting 
        up posters on telephone poles, and of course for jaywalking as well, but 
        there are a lot of nice people in Victoria, especially those involved 
        with the Fringe, from our billets to the administration to all the volunteers. 
        It was very well organized. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We played 
        to an elementary school basketball court with 250 seats. We ourselves 
        were on a raised auditorium stage. If we looked straight out from the 
        stage, we could see the far basketball hoop at eye level, just beyond 
        the last row of seats. Try as we might, we never could think of a good 
        place in the show during which to shoot a basketball at that hoop. Ah 
        well. We managed to fill the house to around 60-100, on average, which 
        was enough to reduce a little bit of the cavernous feeling of the place.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In this particular 
        Fringe, we also had a four-day break in the middle, during which we availed 
        ourselves of the camping opportunities on the west side of Vancouver Island, 
        in and around a town called Tofino, which reminded me of Stinson Beach, 
        California, in the U.S.A. We were given a ride up with the gracious members 
        of the cast of another Fringe show, called Etching. The first night in 
        Tofino, all the good camping areas were full, and we had to stay at a 
        place that was between the golf course and the airstrip. When we got there, 
        our neighbors in the campsite next door were using a chainsaw to cut branches 
        off the trees in their campsite, for firewood. When they finished, they 
        built themselves a nice fire, produced a TV and a VCR and a mysterious 
        power source, and proceeded to watch the movie &quot;Fight Club.&quot; 
        I have never seen &quot;Fight Club,&quot; but I could tell it was &quot;Fight 
        Club&quot; by a section of dialog which occurred early on in the movie, 
        and went like this: &quot;The first rule of Fight Club is that you can't 
        leave. The second rule of Fight Club is that you have to fight.&quot; 
        Or something.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The next 
        day we went to a beautiful campsite on the beach and walked through the 
        coastal rainforest, with lots of moss and ferns and tall trees. I hitchhiked 
        back to town one day before the others. Out of the ten rides I got, three 
        were with recovering heroin addicts. Those who have seen the dark side 
        will always lend a helping hand.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I'm back. 
        nhar. Gustave said I could write some more if I wanted, so here goes again. 
        Well, we went through Prince George and still no word from [the Great 
        One]. I tell you, it is getting tiring, diary. There was a funny smell 
        in the air. Could this be a message? Gustave said no. Threre was a &quot;pulp 
        mill nearby.&quot; Of course, this sounded fishy to me. I was briefly 
        reminded of the grapefruit from the last town, but no. hmmm. We performed 
        in a Native American center and there was a giant dreamcatcher on the 
        wall, so we left behind the dream of Brigitte the Turtle and Henry David 
        Thoreau for it. It was a good catch of the day.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Then we went 
        in a van with some guys who answer any question you can give them. But 
        then their van broke down and nobody knew how to fix it. So we made pasta 
        shells by the side of the road and caught some rays.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Now we're 
        in Victoria. We had to take a boat here, a boat with a belly full of cars 
        and busses and Winnebagoes, like the Nigels have. Victoria is very clean. 
        Soon we will perform. Will [the Great One] be in the audience? If he is, will he have 
        heard Blue Moon before? It's weird, but I think some of the people who 
        have seen the show have heard that song before. somewhere. somehow. humph.

        I miss Winnipeg. Sometimes Saskatoon. And Prince George, where there are 
        many nice people, like Magdalena and Morris and Kenna, who let me stay 
        in her house with her dog and cat and three birds. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Nhar and 
        I met a fellow on the train to Jasper who lives in this town, and who 
        told us the telephone number of a woman who rents out rooms. When we got 
        to Jasper, I called her and said, "Hello, my name is Gustave. I met your 
        friend Kevin on the train, and he said you rent out rooms. Would you have 
        a room available for my friend and I for two days? We are weary after 
        our long journey from Saskatoon." </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">"Yes," she 
        said, "I rent out a room. I have to go to work in about twenty minutes, 
        but if I'm gone when you get here, I'll leave the door to my house open 
        for you." As I have said before, these Canadians are crafty. One must 
        watch them at all times, to make sure they do not take advantage. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The place 
        we came from yesterday, Saskatoon, is a smaller city than Winnipeg, with 
        fewer mosquitoes. It is named after a local berry (actually, they have 
        them in Winnipeg as well) which was particularly fancied by an early explorer.</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"> 
        But I see that it has been so long since my last missive (almost a month! 
        Good heavens) that I must give a brief synopsis of what has happened since 
        then, without the natural history annotation. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We closed 
        in our first Fringe city, Winnipeg, after selling out six out of eight 
        shows. After a brief but delightful camping trip in a mosquito-laden but 
        quite beautiful area northwest of Winnipeg, we proceeded by van to Saskatoon. 
        The Saskatoon Fringe was quite wonderful, and quite a bit slower-paced. 
        My only complaint was the lack of a covering over the beer tent. It rained 
        a lot.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The second 
        best thing to happen to us in Saskatoon was the Critic's Choice Media 
        award, which granted us an extra performance the day after everyone else's 
        shows ended. We shared this honor with two other shows, which got the 
        Critic's Choice Audience award and the Critic's Choice Volunteer award. 
        They selection process was all very democratic for the latter two awards; 
        I assume ours was also, although you never know what those journalists 
        are doing behind closed doors</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The best 
        thing to happen to us by far, though, was the gift we got from our fellow 
        performers. On the last night, hours before we were to catch our 1:20 
        am train for Jasper, we were presented with a card which had been signed 
        by sixteen of our fellow travellers, who will be going to different Fringes 
        than us for the next two runs or so, and whom we will sorely miss.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">We look forward 
        with great anticipation to our next Fringe in Prince George, BC, where 
        our stay will be all too brief. We fervently hope that our five days in 
        that town will be enough for the word of [the Great One] to sink in.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's me, 
        nhar. Gustave told me I could, if I wanted, tell you, diary, about some 
        of our trip. So here goes. First we went to Winnipeg. There we met Clytemnestra 
        and Electra, two women from Seattle; a guy named [the Great One's First 
        Name] from Denver, but his last name wasn't [the Great One's Last Name], 
        it was Quixote; Hitler from England; and some worried clowns from nowhere 
        in particular. In Winnipeg, during the song of killing, one of the owls 
        got very bright and then went out. hmmm. Gustave brought me to stay with 
        a nice man who used to work in a library. He made good food and even changed 
        my sheets. No word from [the Great One].</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When we were 
        done performing there, Clytemnestra and Electra and a guy named Matt took 
        us in a blue van to a slimy lake. There we saw very bright light in the 
        sky, different than the moon and stars. Gustave told me this light was 
        called the northern light. He had never seen it before either, and I thought 
        maybe it was a message from [the Great One], but Gustave says no. I thought I heard 
        it make a noise. But maybe it was just the loudness of the insects. hmmm. 
        We sang Lola by the Kinks around a fire.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then it was 
        here to Saskatoon. It is a city surrounded by sunflowers. And spirals 
        of hay. We are in a nice house with a nice family. one cat named &quot;grizzly&quot;. 
        One day, diary, I was walking through town and I heard a man with a guitar 
        singing [the One True Song]. I stopped and listened. After it was over 
        I checked to see if it was maybe [the Great One] in disguise. No, it wasn't. 
        In Saskatoon we met two teenage pop stars named Nigel and Nigel, and their 
        aunt. They drove around in a Winnebago from the 1980's. Also we met a 
        mindreader named Louis and his assistant Greg. Gustave gave me a grapefruit 
        to protect me from scurvy. hmmm. Still no word from [the Great One].</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm gonna

        Gustave Flaubert, on the road with Nhar. We are now well on our way across 
        Canada, having opened <I>[Motel California] </I> last night, 
        the second night of the Winnipeg Fringe Festival.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Our train 
        journey went well. After leaving New York City on Amtrak's Maple Leaf 
        Express the morning of Friday, July 14th, with a too-brief overnight stopover 
        in the fair city of Toronto, we travelled for thirty hours in a VIA Rail 
        Canada train (it's called the &quot;Canada&quot;) built in the nineteen-fifties, 
        with a restored art deco interior and plenty of friendly Canadians to 
        keep us company, of both the English-speaking variety and the French-speaking 
        variety. Over twenty-four of those thirty hours were spent in the province 
        of Ontario. Ontario has many lakes, and also quite a few trees. I (Gustave) 
        had never been there before. I don't know about Nhar.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Since arriving 
        in Winnipeg, Manitoba, on the afternoon of Sunday, July 16th, we have 
        been quite happy with the warm reception given by all, from our gracious 
        billeting hosts Patrick Wright and Gary Montgomery to everyone at the 
        Winnipeg Fringe Festival, and everyone in Winnipeg. Yesterday a woman 
        we met on the street told us we absolutely had to visit the Historical 
        Museum, then offered to pay for our tickets. Also yesterday, a food vendor 
        sold me a slice of watermelon for the agreed upon price of &quot;one loony&quot; 
        (the Canadian dollar coin has a loon on the back &#151; the two-dollar 
        coin is called a &quot;toony&quot;) and then insisted that I take another 
        slice. Countless other examples abound, but alas, space is limited in 
        this diary.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">They say 
        it is very cold in the winter in Winnipeg, cold enough in fact to freeze 
        exposed skin solid in one minute, but I think that this is not possible, 
        unless you have stopped generating heat from the inside, say for instance 
        if you have recently died of hypothermia. Likewise in the summer they 
        say the mosquitoes blanket the earth, but we haven't seen many. You have 
        to watch these Canadians. They are very friendly and helpful, but I think 
        they are prone to exaggeration and trickery. I count my money when it 
        comes out of the ATM machine, to make sure there is not too much.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">And what 
        about the show, you ask? How much ignorance of [the Great One] has been banished from 
        the world? </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">After about 
        two minutes of orienting ourselves last Sunday, we began to frantically 
        poster the downtown Winnipeg area and to present everyone we met with 
        a postcard, which we were told to call not a postcard but a flyer, which 
        is apparently a more classy designation for our glossy publicity materials. 
        </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Our first 
        performance was last night, Friday, July 21st at 11:00 pm. We had no idea 
        what to expect and were feeling a little lonely without our special guests, 
        but all our evangelism paid off in an opening night crowd of about seventy-five 
        people, which is, to be quite honest, more than we have ever had anywhere 
        outside of Prague.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This excellent 
        turnout will help us in our mission to let the world know of [the Great One] 
        for the rest of the Winnipeg Fringe Festival and for the other Fringes 
        after that, but Nhar and I have resolved not to rest on our laurels. We 
        will continue to spread the word, both inside our show and out, that more

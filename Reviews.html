        by the New York duo of Richard Harrington and Chris Kauffman, is genuinely
        bizarre and, I think, brilliant. And there will be those among you who
        think I'm crazy. This is the team that brought <em>Hotel California</em>
        to the 2001 Fringe, where it was rechristened <em>The Show Formerly Known
        As</em> because of threats from Don Henley's lawyer, which is pretty amusing
        in itself.<br>
        </font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
        If Beckett were funny. ... [reviewer's ellipses] You see, it's not easy
        to describe, much less elucidate, the uniquely deadpan hilarity that informs
        this minimalist vaudeville which is happening, for the very last time,
        before its participants die of hypothermia. It chronicles, in song and
        dance, scientific commentary, the quest of lugubrious Belgian Gustave
        Flaubert, &quot;an artist of ze cabaret,&quot; and his (mostly) silent
        companion Nhar to track down the Yeti at the North Pole. We are 12 kilometres
        from the North Pole, in the middle of a blizzard, helpfully staged by
        Nhar, who scatters white paper confetti. But we are also 8,000 kilometres
        from the North Pole, here in a theatre in Edmonton. &quot;The only way
        to explain it,&quot; says Gustave, &quot;is that you do not exist.&quot;
        But &quot;just because you are a figment, don't sell yourself short.&quot;
        We have been provided with ping-pong balls, and must throw them at the
        stage whenever it appears the pair are about to fall asleep and die.<br>
        <br>
        Why is the story of Gustave's Norwegian grandmother and his &quot;childish
        dream to find the Yeti,&quot; by ancient Peugeot, fishing boat, and finally
        dogsled, so uproarious? It's almost impossible to explain. But it has
        a lot to do with the gravitas of the glum, phlegmatic, uningratiating
        pair onstage: Gustave, who's telling it, and Nhar, in a subservient role,
        grimly providing theatrical props, costume pieces or audiovisual aids
        to assist the master in his presentation. The musical production numbers,
        like The Song Of the Importance Of The European Grandmother, and mime
        sequences have a dogged, flattened out, anti-theatrical quality that is
        hysterical. Their timing is exquisite, full of long, agonizing pauses
        and the tiniest flickering glances.<br>
        <br>
        They've taken the great vaudevillian traditions of silliness and reinvented
        them. And there's genius in that. &#151; <i>Liz Nicholls</i></font></p>

        TV: Sorry, the leading example of this enlivening Fringe experience has
        already up and left town. What you've missed, mes amis, was Gustave Flaubert,
        a gloomy Belgian, and his slightly apologetic assistant Nhar, in a surreal
        cabaret called <em>Nharcolepsy</em> at the North Pole, before they die
        of hypothermia. Meanwhile they take the bottom right out of any previous
        notions of deadpan. Full of brilliantly stupid, but not stupidly brilliant,
        moments. The people who didn't love it hated it. &#151; <i>Liz Nicholls</i><br>

        is Deadly Serious</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the<em>
        Nharcolepsy</em> duo of Richard Harrington and Chris Kauffman, humour
        is a deadly serious business. They crack not a smile as they recount how
        they ended up dying of hypothermia while chasing the Yeti to within 12
        kilometres of the Canadian North Pole.<br>
        <br>
        Kauffman (known as Nhar), the nearly silent of the two, expresses it all
        when he arises out of a one-man sleeping bag with a blue ball. He places
        two plastic figures on it and then covers them with shaving cream. <br>
        <br>
        Something quite momentous is going to take place in glacial wilderness.<br>
        <br>
        You may remember the duo two years ago when they convulsed audiences at
        the Fringe with the deadpan, surreal humour of <em>The Show Formerly Known
        As</em> ...<br>
        <br>
        Who will ever forget Kauffman's memorable delivery of Blue Moon? This
        time the performer, who sounds as if he gargles regularly with Drano,
        does the same service for Stormy Weather.<br>
        Harrington, who calls himself Gustave Flaubert, is partnered with his
        near-mute friend in a cabaret. To prove that he is more than just a pretty
        face, he plays several toy instruments, including a baby accordion and
        a zither.<br>
        <br>
        The two, for reasons that beggar description, are on a quest to track
        down the Yeti who have migrated from Nepal to Northern Canada.<br>
        <br>
        Their humour is both silly and profound. It's all in the timing as they
        milk every pause for all it is worth, waiting and daring the audience
        not to laugh.<br>
        <br>
        They provide us with small plastic balls to throw at them whenever they
        seem to be giving in to hypothermia and we heave them with great enthusiasm
        when they run out of steam.<br>
        <br>
        Gustave spins his tragic tale in his gumbo Flemish accent while Kauffman
        runs around the stage coming up with tacky props to illustrate what his
        partner has to say (plastic packing for snow, stick puppets for the Yeti).<br>
        <br>
        The story comes to a tragic conclusion, but you probably won't notice
        because you'll be laughing so hard. &#8212; <em>Colin MacLean</em><br>

        clowns Richard Harrington and Chris Kauffman wowed me last time they were
        in town (<em>The Show Formerly Known As</em>) and totally blew me away
        in their brand-new production: <em>Nharcolepsy</em>, an odd-ball tale
        of two sad-sack &quot;singer of the cabaret&quot; slowly dying of hyperthermia
        [sic] at the North Pole at the tail end of a trek they've undertaken to
        track down the Yeti.&nbsp; From their mangled, mock-French accents to
        their quirky take on song and dance numbers, this is a show that never
        stops entertaining yet manages to be profoundly and soberingly enlightening
        at the same time (i.e., addressing those HUGE issues of life and death).

        Nope, it's not a typo. &quot;Nharcolepsy&quot; features a fellow named
        Nhar who happens to be afflicted with a terrible sleep disorder. A surreal
        existentialist grab-bag from New York comic duo Harrington &amp; Kauffman,
        &quot;Nharcolepsy&quot; takes hints from the recent success of &quot;Hedwig
        and the Angry Inch,&quot; capitalizing on the humor of silly European
        accents, grim lounge singers and odd physical ailments.<br>
        <br>
        Here's the plot, as best it can be reconstructed: Richard Harrington plays
        a straitlaced Belgian singer named Gustave who, on the advice of his dead
        Belgian grandmother, treks to the North Pole to hunt the elusive Yeti.
        The mostly silent Chris Kauffman plays the titular Nhar, a fellow of unknown
        nationality who follows Gustave to the North Pole for unknown reasons.
        The audience is charged with keeping the hypothermic duo from falling
        asleep by periodically flinging Wiffle balls at the stage. Enemies of
        audience participation, just know this: You'll be so invested in keeping
        these guys awake, you won't even care that you have to be part of the
        show. The two are masters of deadpan humor, intertwining a font of Belgian
        grandmother jokes with a surprising amount of emotionality. <em>&#8212;

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the sheath
        of reviews spilling out of the press packet I received is any indication,
        then Richard Harrington and Chris Kauffman have become the darlings of
        thefringe festival circuit.&nbsp; After spending an hour or so as a part
        of their group hallucination, I think I can understand why.&nbsp; It's
        not easy dealing with the idea that one's existence is merely a manifestation
        of someone else's slowly freezing neural pathways, but Harrington and
        Kauffman in their guises as Belgian &quot;singer of the cabaret&quot;
        Gustave and his mostly mute sidekick Nhar, certainly present as amusing
        an argument as one could wish to justify that this is our actual state
        of being.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With a head
        mix of Existentialism and Absurdism, combined with skillful physical comedy,
        Nharcolepsy is a simple tale told simply and to rib-splitting effect.&nbsp;
        Gustave and Nhar are dying of exposure&nbsp; and hypothermia just a few
        miles shy of the North Pole, where they have journeyed in order to fulfill
        Gustave's life long dream of encountering the legendary yeti.&nbsp; As
        they slowly freeze on the ice flows, they conjure up an audience out of
        the last dregs of their functioning consciousness in order to give one
        final performance, which turns out to be an hilarious recounting of Gustave's
        early childhood, his fascination with the creature that has prompted this
        journey, and the resulting trek from Norway to their present predicament
        at the top of the world.&nbsp; Along the way, we figments of their imagination
        though we may be, are treated to their silly antics performed to Gustave's
        musical accompaniment on a variety of instruments, and are even allowed
        to engage in what surely must be a wish-fulfillment for many audience
        members, being able to pelt the actors onstage with plastic golf balls
        whenever they begin to nod off into unconsciousness.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kauffman
        in particular as the seldom-speaking Nhar proves to be an adept physical
        comedian, while his counterpart Harrington, with his deadpan Jacques Cousteau-influenced
        delivery style is an impressive story-teller.&nbsp; Together they conjure
        an irresistibly infectious world of remote Norwegian village customs,
        goofy made up songs, frolicking polar bears, and a breakdancing Abominable
        Snowman.&nbsp; In description it probably all sounds ludicrous -- which
        it is -- and incomprehensible -- which it almost is.&nbsp; But, on viewing,
        it leaves one with an impression similar to watching Waiting for Godot,
        if Godot were in fact assumed to be the shadow of impending death.&nbsp;
        By the time they succumb to their inevitable fate, Gustave and Nhar have
        used their peculiar brand of humor to teach us a little bit about the
        indomitable human spirit and our ability to discover the best part of
        our selves even in the face of certain oblivion. </font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#151;

        Flaubert (Richard Harrington), this is the story of Gus's childhood dream
        to discover the legendary Yeti, a search that took him to the North Pole,
        where he and his sidekick Nhar (Chris Kauffman) now await certain, frigid
        death. The play is disjointed, but Harrington &amp; Kauffman have great
        chemistry &#151; Harrington is a master straight man and Kauffman is a
        talented physical comedian. Overall, <i>Nharcolepsy </i>is worth the price
        of admission. And the audience gets to play along. Those balls? They're
        for flinging at the actors to wake them from potentially fatal narcoleptic

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An esoteric
        and thoroughly bizarre comedy, Richard Harrington and Chris Kauffman's
        <i>MOTEL CALIFORNIA </i>is an entertaining if brief evening at the theater.
        The 55-minute play tells the story of Gustave Flaubert (Harrington), a
        no-relation-to-the-writer Belgian man with an incredibly thick accent
        who hears the Eagles' song &quot;Hotel California&quot; on a trip to Nepal
        and decides he must become what he calls a &quot;soldier freelance&quot;
        in Colombia. After spending some quality time killing people, he hears
        the song again, and the disembodied voice of Don Henley tells him to stop
        killing people and start a cabaret act. Which he does, with the help of
        his Harpo-on-quaaludes assistant Nhar (Kauffman).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But all of
        this is really neither here nor there. <i>Motel California's </i>plot
        doesn't matter. What matters is the way in which the play displays Harrington
        and Kauffman's odd sense of humor and admirable acting chops. The pair
        met in a workshop in 1997 and put together this two-man show, originally
        titled <i>Hotel California </i>&#151; they changed the name for legal
        reasons &#151; performing it at theaters from New York to Prague, on the
        Canadian fringe-festival circuit, and this past spring at HBO's U.S. Comedy
        Arts Festival in Aspen, Colo. Both actors have an impressive list of credentials,
        including theatrical, dance, and clowning training from institutions around
        the world. Their study shows in this funny yet understated play, precisely
        because the plot doesn't matter.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The actors
        have created two totally inexplicable characters who could probably stand
        on stage brushing their hair for 20 minutes and make you laugh. Baltimore
        native Kauffman occasionally holds a paper plate over his head and sings
        &quot;Blue Moon&quot; in a voice that sounds like he just gargled broken
        glass; elsewhere he pantomimes various actions that sometimes have to
        do with the play &#151; and sometimes don't. Harrington gives an intentionally
        stiff, deadpan performance as the thoroughly humorless yet impressionable
        Gustave, singing awkwardly upbeat songs about growing up in Belgium or
        killing people while playing a tiny accordion. And when the two dance...
        well, it might not sound very funny, but it really is. <i>Motel California
        </i>will leave you laughing even as it has you scratching your head.&#151;

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Tears
        of a Ditchdigger&quot; is an example of butoh theater, a combination of
        live music, structured improvisation and dancing. The avant-garde Japanese
        art form was created in the '60s and strives for spontaneity, emotional
        honesty and a connection to the primitive, through abstract body movements.

        to Nepal, when the disembodied voice of Don Henley spoke to him and pointed
        to the last verse of <i>Hotel California </i>as the key to Gustav's future.
        As anyone would discern, that involved becoming a paid mercenary, a &quot;soldier
        freelance&quot; (delivered a la Hercule Poirot) in Colombia, killing his

        of the ex-Eagle and the inclusion of a variety of expository ditties performed
        on the concertina (<i>petite</i>) by M. Flaubert, whose head is square
        enough to level an I.M. Pei building. Music stretches from Orff to The

        There are two shows at the Fringe this year that render me incapable of
        words. One is <i>Pure Hoopal. </i>And the other is <i>The Show Formerly
        Known As. </i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What are
        these shows about? What is it they do? And why are they so funny?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let me try
        to give you some idea.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There's this
        guy &#151; Chris Kauffman &#151; I think. He doesn't say much. In fact,
        he's mostly a mime. Anyway, he comes out on stage and sings <i>Blue Moon</i>
        in a voice that sounds like he's been gargling with Drano. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While he
        sings, he holds a paper plate on the end of a fork over his head. He seems
        surprised it's there.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then this
        other guy comes out. He tells us he's from Belgium. At least I think he
        says he's from Belgium because he speaks in an accent so thick as to be
        almost impenetrable. He's Richard Harrington &#151; I think. Harrington
        is so deadpan as to make the Old Strathcona fireman's statue look like
        Speedy Gonzales. While Harrington is telling us about his career as a
        ruthless mercenary (actually I think he calls it a &quot;soldier of freelance&quot;)
        in Colombia and Nepal in this pea soup accent and carrying this plastic
        toy gun (I am not making this up), Kauffman runs around miming out parts
        of his story, playing the music, setting up the mikes and generally acting
        as a major domo.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Every once
        in a while Harrington sings a song that neither rhymes, scans nor makes
        much sense.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At one point
        he decides to dance, and there hasn't been such a display since St. Vitus
        went to his reward.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once you
        get into the right space &#151; all of this is laugh-out-loud, uproariously
        funny.</font></p>

        and Chris Kauffman offer the sort of engaging inventiveness that one wants
        to see more of. Both performers seeize the attention, but it's Kauffman
        who steals the show with his talent for mime, his plaintively hoarse voice
        and his delightfully expressive face. It has something to do with Walden
        Pond, the life of a mercenary and, well, Don Henley. It's rough, tender
        adn terribly funny, and you can't take your eyes off it. I'm not entirely
        sure I know what this show is about, but I wouldn't mind seeing it again
        all the same. &#151; <i>Kevin Wilson</i><br>

        Harrington and Chris Kauffman hit the big time when a recent favorable
        review of their show <i>Hotel California </i>said basically that and added,
        &quot;At times you're not quite sure why their material is so funny.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Like the
        critics, audiences have been responding favorably to the duo's show during
        performances at the St. Mark's Theater, the New York International Fringe
        Festival and even the Mezi Ploty Festival of Theater in Prague. For the
        next four Sundays, Harrington &amp; Kauffman will be performing <i>Hotel
        California </i> at the Westbeth Theatre Center.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So now that
        you've been told how indescribable the show is, it's time for the description.
        (Of course, in situations like these, it's best to go ask the artist.)
        &quot;Ostensibly, it's about two characters trying to put on a cabaret,&quot;
        says Harrington. &quot;One is a former mercenary, the other is this mysterious
        character that barely speaks. It's basically a clown show.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wondering
        about the familiar title? Yes, the classic Eagles song also factors into
        the show. &quot;A large part of the story,&quot; continues Harrington,
        &quot;is one character hearing the song in various places &#151; and it
        tells him to do things.&quot; At least it's not &quot;Helter Skelter.&quot;

        opposite end of the entertainment spectrum is <i>Hotel California</i>
        at NADA 45, featuring the talented comedy duo of Richard Harrington and
        Chris Kauffman. Harrington plays Gustave Flaubert, a mercenary from Belgium
        who has given up his life of killing to star in his own cabaret show;
        Kauffman is his mostly silent assistant, Nhar. At times, you're not quite
        sure why their material is so funny. Is it Harrington's cartoonish Belgian
        accent? His deadpan delivery? Kauffman's confused facial expressions or
        thin, scratchy singing voice? The two actors work well together and with
        the odd guest artists they bring in (which at the performance I attended
        included a zany pair of dancers grooving to a medley of songs from the
        '70s and early '80s, a supposedly French professor who literally demonstrated
        humankind's evolution, and a folk singer crooning a love ballad to his
        stuffed monkey). The show fits in perfectly with the festival's exploration
        of popular culture, drawing from rock music, vaudeville, and several other
        sources for inspiration.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

        California,&quot; which is being revived through March 3 at the St. Mark's
        Theater.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Hotel
        California&quot; is my favorite kind of Fringe production: a couple of
        skilled performers with a dangerously subtle sense of comedy and an impassioned
        embrace of no-budget theater. The show, directed by Patricia Buckley,
        is ostensibly an earnest attempt at New York cabaret performance by a
        former mercenary killer from Belgium named Gustave Flaubert (Richard Harrington).
        Gustave believes the voice of singer/songwriter Don Henley of the '70s
        supergroup the Eagles &#151; whose rock anthem lends the show its title
        &#151; has led him to this new career.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The faithful
        sidekick to this assassin-turned-song-stylist is the barely audible Nhar
        (Chris Kauffman). Nhar opens the show with a raspy rendition of &quot;Blue
        Moon,&quot; which he delivers to a styrofoam plate held over his head
        on the end of a marshmallow fork. You might have to see this to understand
        how hilarious it is.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both performers
        have a gift for props, whether it's a toy accordion or a string of owl-shaped
        lawn lanterns that acquire an unexpectedly sinister air with the right
        background music. Elizabeth Greenman's lighting meshes nicely with the
        sound design of Harrington, Kauffman, and Ian P. Murphy. The wild cards
        in this evening of controlled chaos are guest artists like Spencer White,
        a fantastic guitar player and folk singer who, at a recent show, performed
        a wildly catchy ode to fiber supplements, and Dr. Nicki, a seemingly unassuming
        woman who rather convincingly spoke the language of dolphins.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The program
        states that &quot;Hotel California&quot; is Harrington &amp; Kauffman's
        first project together. I am excited and a little afraid to see what these
        two will do next. &#151; <i>Andy Buck<br>

        recommended you for the shirt with the long sleeves. But &quot;Hotel California&quot;
        is a triumph. Both Richard Harrington as the mercenary, Gustave Flaubert,
        and Chris Kauffman as Nhar, his solicitous assistant, are perfect in their
        respective roles. Harrington's dead-pan seems a miracle in the face of
        what he's saying (and singing), not to mention what Mr. Kauffman is up
        to. This is comedy of the highest order and I've never heard a version
        of The Eagles' classic song that I like as much as this one. Sell all
        your old albums if you have to in order to catch this show. Along with

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The largest

        humour of Chris Kauffman, who plays the role of Nhar, and Richard Harrington,
        who is Gustave Flaubert. Together, Nhar and Gustave are a comedic team
        of clockwork precision that are able to send their audience into convulsion
        with a single unblinking gaze from their Spartan stage.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kauffman's
        Nhar is very nearly a mime (you'll have to buy a ticket to figure out
        what that means) and he is also the tiny hamster that makes the play's
        moving parts hum. Harrington's Gustave is, well, difficult to describe.
        Imagine comic Steven Wright trying to do Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau.
        (Once again, seeing will be believing.) Together, they present a twisted
        and demented ode to Don Henley, singer-songwriter and apparently fan of
        the world's oldest profession.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What finally
        makes Hotel California hum, however, is the sheer and effortless humour
        in every twitch, shuffle and utterance. Although not for everyone, those
        with a healthy and broad-minded sense of humour will definitely get it.

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This silly
        cabaret is a toy box full of way-off-the-wall surprises. Gustave Flaubert
        (Richard Harrington), aided by the downtrodden Nhar (Chris Kauffman) tells
        us why Don Henley is great. He begins by reading a passage from a soft-porn
        novel written by pros who allegedly serviced Henley, and who claimed to
        have exclaimed during the act, &quot;Oh, Don, you're the king!&quot; and
        &quot;Check me into the Hotel California!&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Flaubert
        is first smitten with the '70s anthem while on holiday in Nepal, and hears
        &quot;Don speak to me. It was clear. I had to kill people.&quot; (At this
        point, Nhar rushed out with a plastic crossbow). It was also Nhar's duty
        to provide interpretive dance for the non-rhyming, autobiographical tunes
        Flaubert spoke-sang, accompanying himself on squeezebox. There's even
        an audience game where the winner gets a Belgian beer and their snapshot
        taken on stage. And, yes, after a funny 55 minutes, you can leave. &#151;

        California&quot; defies description. New York's Richard Harrington and
        Chris Kauffman present an odd, odd story with determined, dead pan delivery.
        And it works. Yes, the tale of a Belgian mercenary who gives up his life
        of killing for a life in the cabaret &#151; all thanks to Don Henley and
        the song, &quot;Hotel California&quot; &#151; somehow works. It's one
        of the best things at the Fringe &#151; truly strange and hilariously
        absurd. &#151; <i>Jennifer Weber<br>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On paper,
        there's nothing funny about <i>Hotel California. </i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It's a two-man
        show. One fellow, named Nhar, is a really good mime with a really bad
        voice. The other, Gustave Flaubert, is a really bad singer, a really bad
        musician and an even worse dancer.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As Gustave
        tells his life-story &#151; about growing up in Belgium, his trip to Nepal,
        his career as a freelance killer in Colombia and the pair of epiphanies
        he had listening to the Eagles' <i>Hotel California </i>on the radio &#151;
        Nhar illustrates with mime. He also serves as props master, sound and
        lighting tech and general flunky for Gustave's performance.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">None of that
        may sound particularly funny. But this show is laugh-out-loud hilarious.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It's all
        in the delivery &#151; or lack thereof. Gustave (played by New York-based
        actor and director Richard Harrington) serves up a perfectly stone-faced
        diatribe. The impeccably dressed storyteller never so much as cracks a
        smile throughout &#151; even as he plays his tiny squeeze-box accordion
        for the third time (same four-line tune, different non-rhyming lyrics,
        once in Spanish).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nhar (played
        by fellow New Yorker Chris Kauffman) is all wide-eyed servitude, taking
        care of Gustave's every need. Only once does he lose his head, when he
        becomes so overcome by the music that he takes off in a non-Gustave-sanctioned
        direction.</font></p>

        gets my vote for the show among shows. It was wildly funny, cosmically
        intelligent and acted by two absolutely wonderful dramatists. Richard
        Harrington and Chris Kauffman were worthy recipients of the only standing
        ovation I saw all Fringe long. Truly unique and impressive in spirit and
        presentation. &#151; <i>Frank Peebles<br>

        funny about Belgians? Is it the clothes? The music? Waffles? Well, whatever
        it is, Richard Harrington seems to have nailed it with his character,
        Gustave Flaubert. Aided by his strange, Igor-like, clown sidekick, Nhar
        (Chris Kauffman, whose raspy-voiced renditions of Blue Moon and Rocketman
        get enormous laughs), Harrington's performance keeps audiences rolling
        in the aisles. &#151; <i>Peter Vesuwalla</i></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i><br>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although
        it veers toward being too twee, this is still a charming little spoof.
        Richard Harrington stars as Gustave Flaubert, not the author of <i>Madame
        Bovary </i>but a rather boring Belgian whose career choice (soldier of
        fortune) is based in ethereal encounters with The Eagles' drummer Don
        Henley (thus the show's title, with the tune to be performed in hilariously
        bad deadpan).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chris Kauffman
        is Nhar, a floundering assistant who opens the show with a deliberately
        garbled rendition of <i>Blue Moon </i>and then spends his time falling
        all over Flaubert. Why we'd be interested in this schlep's disjointed
        nonsense, delivered in fractured English, is precisely what's so funny
        about this homage to absurdism. &#151; <i>Peter Birnie<br>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This oddball
        comedy is one of those Fringe gems that makes you laugh without knowing
        quite why. It's so absurd, it defies description.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hotel California
        features Richard Harrington as Gustave Flaubert, a Belgian mercenary-turned-cabaret-performer.
        Chris Kauffman is his sidekick, Nhar.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It's the
        story of how Gustave's life has been shaped by his all-time hero, Don
        Henley of the Eagles, and in particular, the classic '70's tune Hotel
        California. The tale unfolds through their attempt at putting on a cabaret
        show, which is unquestionably bad.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nhar opens
        the show with an eccentric rendition of Blue Moon. His raspy voice is
        barely audible as he holds up the moon: a Styrofoam plate attached to
        a fork.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gustave then
        makes his grand entrance, starting out with a weird tale about Henley's
        alleged penchant for prostitutes. He backtracks to his childhood days
        growing up with his best friends Jean-Paul and Paul-Pierre and then moves
        on to tell how he came to choose a career in killing. In between, there's
        a pop quiz with the prize of an imported beer. It all gets stranger from
        there.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Harrington
        is a top notch performer, his deadpan delivery bang-on. His character
        is exceptionally well-drawn, from his subtle mannerisms and little asides
        to his quirky accent that is reminiscent of Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau
        at times.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kauffman's
        clownish character, who is mostly silent, moves the action along, adding
        laughs with his subtle physical comedy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The show's
        finale is an absolute riot: Gustave sings a passionate version of the
        venerable Hotel California, complete with props and goofball dancing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Check into
        the Hotel California early. It's sure to be a sellout. &#151; <i>Jenny

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">New York-based performers <strong>Richard Harrington</strong> and <strong>Chris Kauffman</strong> met in a clown workshop with David Shiner (<em>Fool Moon, Cirque du Soleil</em>) in 1997 and began to craft the unusual blend of comedy, absurdity, tragedy, geography and accordion music that eventually became the two-man team of Belgian cabaret singer Gustave and his associate Nhar. Harrington &amp; Kauffman debuted their first Gustave and Nhar show, <a href="shows.html#motelcali"><strong>Motel California</strong></a>, in 1999, and followed it up with <a href="shows.html#nharco"><strong>Nharcolepsy</strong></a> in 2002. Each of these shows toured for several years around North America and the world. In 2009 they developed and began to perform their third show, <a href="shows.html#cabaret"><strong>Cabaret Terrarium</strong></a>. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 2016, with animator <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mikescottanimation.com/">Mike Scott</a> and musician <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/raiven_hunter">Raiven Hansmann</a>, Harrington &amp; Kauffman completed their first animation project: <a target="_blank" href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/184946795"><strong>Gustave and Nhar at Le Yeti Rouge</strong></a>.</font></p>



<P> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Note:  <strong>Motel California</strong> started out with the name <strong>Hotel California</strong>, and for 
        legal reasons related to a cease and desist order from attorneys for Don Henley, it is now 
        called <strong>Motel California</strong>, after a brief period in which it was called 
        <strong>The Show Formerly Known As</strong>.)</font></P>

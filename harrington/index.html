  From New YOrk City (wherever that is) comes writer/performer Richard Harrington 
  with a show about his six-week summer gig as a tortoise inspector in the middle 
  of the Arizona desert. And it's 85 per cent true. Richard is the sweetest guy, 
  and he's not afraid to share every detail of that summer. He talks about firls, 
  drugs, panic attacks, Steppenwolf &#8212; and he's so polite. He converts all 
  termperature references to Celsius, has maps for the geographically challenged 
  andd turns his bottle of orange juice, giving equal time to the French and English 
  labels. See this show, especially if you think your job sucks. &#8212; <em>KL</em><br>

  Richard Harrington draws you into his tale of a &quot;really fucked up job&quot; 
  he had 11 years ago. As an environmental inspector, a.k.a. turtle herder, he 
  was responsible for ensuring that bulldozers didn't run over desert tortoises, 
  12 hours a day, six days a week in the ridiculously hot sun of western Arizona. 
  Harrington's deadpan delivery torques up his story's inherent humour, and his 
  honest recounting of being a 21-year-old discovering the capriciousness of the 
  plant kingdom, petty tyranny and lovers is altogether endearing. &#8212; <em>Thea

  Last year Richard Harrington brought his &quot;Hotel California&quot; to the 
  Fringe and it was sheer delight. This year he has brought a mere portion of 
  a prequel to that irresistible play, and I find it no less delightful. Don't 
  expect too close a narrative connection (the character of Gustave Flaubert &#8212; 
  no relation to the novelist &#8212; is all you need to know and all he needs 
  to go). Flaubert works himself into the end of a story about a job Harrington 
  had in 1991 to save the Desert Tortoise, an endangered species. It's sanity 
  that seems endangered in this hilarious tale about love and boredom and mushrooms 
  and malignant cactii and the cauterizing Arizona sun. All these things &#8212; 
  and much more &#8212; are woven into a story about three days in the desert 
  that is flawlessly told. Harrington's humour is impossible to describe. Like 
  the story itself, it seems to be about almost nothing. But just below the surface 
  of his performance and his writing is a vast reservoir of intelligence and skill 
  that is utterly concealed. It's easy to take this show at face value &#8212; 
  it seems merely brilliant and absurdly funny &#8212; but that's a desert illusion. 
  Just like on the Tortoise lookout, he's working all the time. &#8212; <em>Robert

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...New York performer 
  Richard Harrington presents a wry look at a summer job he once had as an eco-sentry 
  on an Arizona pipeline construction project. His straight-ahead narrative and 
  blackboard-style graphics (Canada is shown as a question mark above his crudely 
  drawn map of the U.S.) stuck on the curtains behind him give the performance 
  a grade-school charm. Except that the subject matter is more adult.<br>
  </font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  With his blunt Sgt. Friday delivery, Harrington manages to communicate the searing 
  boredom of the job -- standing in the sun watching for endangered tortoises 
  to protect them from the bulldozers -- with an eye for detail that creates a 
  vivid portrait of a small Arizona town and the pipeline workers Harrington meets. 
  After-hours rituals such as smoking up, sneaking into a female co-worker's bedroom, 
  eating at Taco Bell and checking out the hot tub at the Days Inn develop legendary 
  status through his deadpan delivery. Highlights include painful encounters with 
  the Teddybear Cholla cactus and a conversation with a talking tortoise.<br>
  <br>
  While he has a very different style from the breathless, high-speed monologues 
  of TJ Dawe (whose own Uno show is about jobs), Harrington's relaxed, colloquial 
  soliloquy has its own down-home appeal. &#8212; <em>Susan Down </em><br>

  part unless you've already seen the show or you don't mind being really confused).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1991, the year 
  this show takes place, Bullhead City elected its first mayor, Mike Love. Bullhead 
  City also became in that year the host of the Turquoise Circuit Rodeo.<br>
  <br>
  The real name of the casino referred to in the show as the &#8220;Riverboat&#8221; 
  is the &#8220;Riverside.&#8221; The history of the Riverside Hotel and Resort, 
  which is deeply intertwined with the history of the city of Laughlin, can be 
  found on the back of every placemat in every bar and restaurant in Bullhead 
  City. In September 2001, Pat Benatar played at the Riverside.<br>
  <br>
  The blasting of sandstone by the construction company, the preparation and aftermath 
  of which are described in the show, was always touched off by the same demolition 
  expert, who had long hair, wore a bandana with a confederate flag on it and 
  no shirt. Every time, he lit the fuse and then turned and walked slowly back 
  towards the safe area where the rest of us were all standing. He stopped halfway, 
  turned around and squatted down to watch the blast. When the slow part of the 
  fuse hit the Primacord part of the fuse, which burns at thirty kilometers per 
  second and was connected to all the charges, a 50-meter stretch of hill raised 
  itself a meter and a half and stayed there. And then the boredom resumed.<br>
  <br>
  The construction site described in the show was due east of Bullhead City, about 
  halfway down Interstate 40 to Kingman, Arizona, which was the home of Timothy 
  McVeigh for the few months before he blew up the federal building in Oklahoma 
  City.<br>
  <br>
  Robert Paxton McCulloch was the head of the McCulloch chainsaw company. The 
  price he paid for the London Bridge, $2.5 million, was not the high bid, but 
  the London officials allegedly like the idea that the bridge would be going 
  from one of the oldest cities in the world, London, to one of the newest, Lake 
  Havasu.<br>
  <br>
  The character in the show named Darrell is one of the few with no basis in reality, 
  or very little. I did get a two-bedroom apartment in Flagstaff that fall, but 
  it was with another member of the tortoise crew, named Jennifer. She was not 
  the character named Jen in the show, whose real name was something else. The 
  name of Darrell&#8217;s pitbull, Fidel, is actually the real name of the pitbull 
  owned jointly by my brother and my mother. Fidel is extremely cute. He is white 
  with black spots, exactly like Petey on the Little Rascals. Fidel&#8217;s hair 
  is so short that when he gets wet, he becomes pink with black spots. Fidel was 
  procured by my brother&#8217;s girlfriend&#8217;s roommate (at the time &#8211; 
  now she is my brother&#8217;s ex-girlfriend&#8217;s ex-roommate). She was admiring 
  the puppy in a box on the street near her apartment in San Francisco. Its owner, 
  who bred pitbulls for fighting, told her the dog had a broken leg and that they 
  were going to use it for practice, but that she could have it for fifty bucks. 
  When he turned his back, she stole it. She brought it back to the apartment 
  and then she left for L.A. for three days. When she returned, my brother and 
  his girlfriend had gotten a cast put on the puppy, named it Fidel, and forbid 
  the roommate from attempting to take care of it. Somehow, my mom ended up saddled 
  with Fidel a few months later, but now my brother took him back a few years 
  later, and only makes my mom take the dog when he goes on vacation.<br>
  <br>
  Gentleman Jim was the real name of a pitbull that I lived with the following 
  spring in Flagstaff, who was owned by Jennifer&#8217;s ex-boyfriend Tom, my 
  new roommate. We really did spend many an evening sitting around the living 
  room staring back at the dog, discussing theories of its origin. The namesake 
  of Tom&#8217;s dog was Gentleman Jim Corbett, a boxer born in San Francisco 
  in 1866. Corbett came from a middle-class family and changed boxing in America 
  into a respectable sport, inasmuch as it can be considered so today. The bout 
  in which he took the heavyweight title from John L. Sullivan in 1892 was the 
  first heavyweight fight in which both participants wore gloves.* During the 
  five years that Gentleman Jim held the heavyweight title, he performed often 
  on the stage, and he continued acting well into his retirement.<br>
  <br>
  Last, but not least, I should point out that while the tortoise job itself was 
  incredibly surreal, the management of the environmental consulting company was 
  not nearly as fucked up as I make it out to be in this play.<br>
  <br>
  *This was thought to be more civilized at the time, although we know now that 
  gloves just allow boxers to avoid technical knockouts resulting from heavy bleeding. 
  They can thereby fight longer matches, thus suffering more brain damage over 
  the course of their careers.</font></p>

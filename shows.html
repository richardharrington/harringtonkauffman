      <p><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Richard Harrington 
        plays Gustave, a simple Belgian village boy who hears a mysterious 
        call from Don Henley, frontman for the world's best-selling rock band 
        of all time, The Eagles (with whom Harrington &amp; Kauffman have no affiliation, 
        past or present). Gustave&#146;s narration is cleverly complemented by 
        the subtle mime routines of his co-conspirator and occasional spoiler, 
        Chris Kauffman&#146;s Nhar, who is unable to verbally convey his message 
        but harbors eternal hopes of doing his own musical number. The story spans 
        the globe and beyond, with tales of Colombia, Nepal, and the skies over 
        Walden Pond. </FONT></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Through it 
        all, Nhar performs mime routines, sings songs, sets up the mike, runs 
        the sound, fetches all the props, and does whatever else it takes to make 
        things run smoothly while Gustave tells the audience the story of his 
        life.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the end 
        of the show, when Gustave finally discovers his musical mentor's true 
        intentions for him, the engagingly weird narrative emerges as a tale of 
        welcome and redemption.</font></p>

        California,</b> directed by Patricia Buckley of the Montreal and Toronto 
        Fringe hit clown group <b>Gams on the Lam</b>, debuted at <b>Surf Reality</b> 
        in New York City and has performed at the <b>Westbeth Theatre Center</b>, 
        the <b>New York International Fringe Festival</b>, and many other New 
        York venues. It has toured to <b>Theatreproject</b> in Baltimore, to the 
        <b>Buntport Theater</b> in Denver, Colorado and to the <b>Revolutions 
        Festiv</b><strong>al</strong> at the <b>Tricklock Theater</b> in Albuquerque, 
        New Mexico, as well as to <b>Gettysburg College</b> in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Internationally, 
        the show has toured the Canadian Fringe Festival circuit (Montreal, Winnipeg, 
        Saskatoon, Edmonton, Calgary, Prince George, Victoria, Vancouver) as well 
        as performing at the </FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><b>Mezi 
        Ploty </b>("Between the Lines") theater and music festival, a major cultural 
        event in the Czech Republic held on the grounds of the Bohnice Psychiatric 
        Institute outside Prague, at which thousands of festival guests mix with 
        the patients for a weekend of theater and loud music. Harrington &amp; 
        Kauffman's participation in the event was made possible in part by a grant 
        from the U.S. Information Service. </FONT></P>
      <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the spring 
        of 2001, the show performed at HBO's Aspen Comedy Festival, shortly after 
        which it changed its name from <b>Hotel California</b> to <b>The Show 
        Formerly Known As</b>, and then later on that year to <b>Motel California, 
        </b>which it remains to this day.</font></P>

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Nharcolepsy</b> 
        once again stars Harrington's 
        &amp; Kauffman's alter-egos, Gustave and Nhar.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Nharcolepsy</b> 
        begins with Gustave and Nhar informing the audience that they themselves 
        are not in a theater, but are, in fact, stuck in a blizzard twelve miles 
        from the North Pole. Thus, as they succumb to hypothermia, the audience 
        must be a figment of their imagination. The duo then begin the last show 
        of their careers, performing numbers that tell the story of how Gustave's 
        childhood obsession with finding the Yeti (the Himalayan ape-like creature 
        who has eluded western explorers and biologists for decades) led to their 
        current predicament.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In order 
        to keep them alive until the end of the show, each audience member is 
        issued a white practice golf ball to throw at the characters whenever 
        they succumb to hypothermia and fall asleep. The balls look dangerous, 
        but they don't hurt, very much. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Nharcolepsy</strong> 
        has toured to the Toronto, Thunder Bay, Winnipeg, Victoria, San Francisco and New 
        York Fringe Festivals, as well as the <b>Buntport Theater</b> in Denver, 
        Colorado, to the <strong>Revolutions Festival</strong> at the <b>Tricklock 
        Theater</b> in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and to <b>Gettysburg College</b> 
        in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. In New York, it has performed independent 
        runs at the <strong>Red Room</strong> and at the <strong>Gene Frankel 
        Theatre</strong>.</font></p>

<P> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
A man is found inside a block of ice at the North Pole by Norwegian archeologists.  They defrost him.  He has no memory of his past.  He has a birthmark on his belly in the shape of a frog, a matchbook in his pocket, and a microphone in his hand.  And he has a Belgian accent.  He doesn't know his name, but there is one thing he is sure of:  that he is a singer of the cabaret.</font></p>

<P> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Soon, the man learns that his name is Gustave, and he re-imagines for himself a travelling companion:  his mostly mute friend and associate Nhar, whom he lost on the ice.  With the help of Nhar, Gustave tracks down his family and his past, first in Belgium, then in Colombia, and then finally in the redwood forests of Northern California.  The more places he visits, the more he begins to realize the awful truth about his own shadowy misdeeds.  </font></p>
<P> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The tale of this quest and its dramatic conclusion is told in narrative, musical numbers and re-enactment by Gustave and Nhar, who complements Gustave's deadpan storytelling with his subtle mime routines and musical accompaniment.  </font></p>
<P> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's Jason Bourne meets Samuel Beckett meets Serge Gainsbourg, except Gustave and Nhar take themselves far more seriously than any of those guys, which is the key to Harrington & Kauffman's comedy.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Cabaret Terrarium</strong> has performed at the Edmonton, Winnipeg, and Vancouver Fringe Festivals in Canada, at the San Franciso Fringe Festival, The Box Performance Space in Albuquerque and Buntport Theater in Denver, and at the Antidepressant Festival, the International Clown Theater Festival, and Triskelion Arts, all in New York City.
